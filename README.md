# Daily Kattis Problem Solving Challenge

Welcome to my Daily Kattis Problem Solving repository! 👋

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

I've embarked on a journey to solve one [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) problem every day to sharpen my programming skills and algorithmic thinking. This repository serves as a log of my progress and a showcase of my solutions.

## 🚀 Motivation

By consistently tackling diverse programming challenges, I aim to:
- Enhance my problem-solving abilities
- Improve my coding efficiency
- Expand my knowledge of algorithms and data structures
- Build a habit of continuous learning and improvement

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each problem solution is stored in its own directory, named after the problem or the date it was solved. The structure typically includes:

- The solution file (e.g., `problem_name.py`)
- A README.md explaining the problem and approach (when applicable)

## 🧩 Problems Solved So Far

1. [2048](./2048/README.md) - A simulation of the 2048 game mechanics
2. [99 Problem](./99-Problem/README.md) - Finding the nearest price ending in 99
3. [A Cappella Recording](./a-capella-recording/README.md) - Calculating the minimum number of recordings for an a cappella song
4. [Bit by Bit](./Bit-by-Bit/README.md): Manipulate individual bits of a 32-bit register based on a sequence of instructions.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python (primary language)
- Other languages may be added as I progress

## 🤝 Contribution

While this is a personal challenge, I'm open to discussions about the problems and alternative solutions. Feel free to open an issue if you'd like to discuss a particular problem or solution!

## 📈 Progress

I started this challenge on October 15 2024. Check back regularly to see my latest solutions!
